# weather-app
This project has written mainly by Stewart Lynch who I studied with his Swift Weather App Course.
Open Weather Map API was used to get the weather data for the app. It was originally displayed the daily forecast for the 5 days.
I modified the code for 3-hour Forecast 5 days API key and created a new JSON model. The app displays the oncoming 5 days forecast with 3 hour interval.
